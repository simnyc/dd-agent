instances:
  # By default, this check will run against a single instance - the current
  # machine that the Agent is running on. It will check the WMI performance
  # counters for IIS on that machine.
  #
  # If you want to check other remote machines as well, you can add one
  # instance per host. Note: If you also want to check the counters on the
  # current machine, you will have to create an instance with empty params.
  #
  # The `sites` parameter allows you to specify a list of sites you want to
  # read metrics from. With sites specified, metrics will be tagged with the
  # site name. If you don't define any sites, the check will pull the
  # aggregate values across all sites.
  #
  # If you need to get metrics from all the sites you can set `get_all_sites`
  # to true and will not have to use `sites` to specify list of sites. 
  # Note that `sites` and `get_all_sites` are not compatible
  #
  # Here's an example of configuration that would check the current machine
  # and a remote machine called MYREMOTESERVER. For the remote host we are
  # only pulling metrics from the default site.
  #

  # "." means the current host
